# SportsBettingSim

An ML project that predicts outcomes for football matches and simulates a betting strategy.

## Features

- Logistic Regression based match outcome prediction
- Simulation of betting strategy with threshold confidence levels
- Accuracy visualization over match timeline


## How it Works

1. Load and clean football match data
2. Employs an odds difference feature
3. Train a machine learning model to classify match outcomes into home win, draw, away win
4. Use the model to simulate betting strategies on unseen data (matches_test.csv)
5. Visualize cumulative prediction accuracy
